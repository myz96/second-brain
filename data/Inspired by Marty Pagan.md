* Aim for inclusive definition of product, for an e-commerce store this includes everything from the fulfilment experience to the website UI
* Actual work should revolve around continuous cycles of discovery and delivery

* Build real teams with prolonged and frequent problem solving

* Get quick qualitative insights for discovery and leads, but quantitative insights to prove evidence and to build conviction

* Stakeholders are people who can veto your product, others are just people who are apart of the community

* Just after 1 week of discovery, we need the preview this idea with all stakeholders 

* Great way to do this is to have a weekly coffee or lunch with most important stakeholders
