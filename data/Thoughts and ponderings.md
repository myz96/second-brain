* Jensen Huang from Nvidia has some great quotes and learning

* He thinks of his company first and formost as a network or platform builder

* Build something cool a decade early, then nurture other people around the product, a community that builds or buys into the culture or features 

* He thinks strategy is about learning a lot about the world and then applying it to his situation 
* He thinks it’s about moving to where a future huge market is and doing that super well, positioning the company so that’s it’s ready to catch the Apple from the tree when it happens

* Your mum and dad compliment each other in so many ways and since you and Ashley were born, their whole life has been about making the best life for you both. When you both went off to high school, I though it was so impressive that they chose different schools for you both where they hoped and believed you’d both thrive, knowing that you’d be fine anywhere but Ashley needed just the right place. Not all parents think in this way and I imagine it was Ashley’s saving grace. Your mum and dad are wonderful people, Michael. Life is wonderful, too, but also hard and a continual learning process - and they are still teaching each other a lot of things 😊 and learning a lot from you and Ashley. ☘️

* CBT says instead of should say prefer, CBT for dummies

* Chris Voss in Never split the difference reminds us to always actually seek no in negotiations, giving examples that when we gun for Yes that’s when people are actually the most annoyed and want to get out. Give them the control, let them say no, ask them what we can do?

* “Professionals stick to the schedule, amateurs let life get in the way” - James Clear
* “Until you work as hard as those you admire don’t explain away their success as luck” - James Clear

* When sticking with a new habit set a quit threshold when it’s just not for me and I can try something new

* Filter habits by those that make sense to me and my personality, strength based not just what other people say, aligns with the identity I want
