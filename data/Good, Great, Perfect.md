# Good, Great, Perfect

# Goo# d# , Gre# at# , Per# fect

* It is worth getting better at consciously changing your inner voice of judgement and criticism
* Good enough helps a lot as a default state (85% trying), promotes sustainability, promotes getting started, and then allows you to come back and iterate

* Helped a lot when trying to redo my resume, just getting something there allowed me to get into flow to finish it off

* I rarely think about perfectionism, or high levels of expectation, its impact on my underlying anxiety in some but not ALL areas of my life

* It was nice that I was able to spend a couple of hours thinking about perfectionism in this context
