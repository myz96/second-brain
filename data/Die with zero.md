# Die with zero

Pretty interesting book all round. Was a bit skeptical at the beginning but I came around to really enjoy it. I think it’s the thought I had when I was 13 that I wanted to maximise life experience extrapolated into a fully formed idea, applied to one’s life. Interesting to see that others also had this idea, probably why I like elements of maximisation and optimisation. 

Some lessons I took away from the book are, be ambitious, especially when you are young, below even 35, your life and energy is maximised now, not in 10 years. While people aim for contentment and routine, I think I should strive towards that just because they have it. Everyone’s life is so unique and their situations are so varied. 

Be confident in defining the life you want to live. Be mature about it. You know yourself the best, so make those hard decisions with confidence that it is in your own interests. Be open to their criticism and rebuke, but do not dwell on it for they have their own ideas. 

Strive and aim high, not for wealth but because it’s what you want to do and accomplish. If I want to be in business, if I want to work with small businesses, why not try that. Let’s spend a bit of time exploring. Maybe like my cafe idea it’s less sexy irl, and I can keep going but I shouldn’t shy away just because I don’t know anyone who’s like that and who likes entrepreneurship like that. 

There are so many things you actually end up wanting to do, don’t hesitate. Don’t aim for a number but evaluate your health.

Also, cool opportunity cost calc is would you prefer this experience once now or twice in 10 years. See how many years left you have to enjoy a hobby. Snowboarding might only be 7 years of opportunity left. Let’s try maximise this even if it’s expensive. 

I can climb, later. Even basketball you only have 3-4 years left, let’s enjoy it. Learn to shoot and get more skilled.

Festivals are now. We can save more in the future. Especially the track I’m on now. It should be fine, just to ride this path. Don’t be scared, we’ll all be ok, one way or another.
