Acquired Pinduoduo episode took 10% market share from Alibaba.com in 3 years from launch. This is cool because how does a new entrant enter china when it’s already so relatively mature with Alibaba.com and Tennent?

Acquired Pinduoduo episode talks about how they used WeChat as a social platform to build a mini app that then went viral since people from tier 3 and tier 4 cities were able to buy really cheap goods together, this is really cool because it’s a proxy for a retail disrupter, aggregating demand on the buyer side and allowing them to go straight to a manufacturer 

Amazon Working Backwards Prime Video chapter says that Amazon Unbox was one of the first digital video platforms, likely born out of their kindle success, but they still failed behind Apple that had greater success with movies and iTunes on their iPod.

In Flow, it says “Commitment that an old-fashioned marriage demands, and having made it willing instead of being compelled by tradition, a person no longer needs to worry whether she has made the right choice, or whether the grass might be greener somewhere else. As a result a great deal of energy gets freed up for living, instead of being spent on wondering about how to live.” This brings up a very interesting point around the value and trade off about optimising or planning or strategising your life as opposed to experiencing and living it. It makes me think of the article on optimisation that Kev showed me. https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-9-what-it-means-to-optimise

The many examples of flow and optimal experience in Flow by Michael Csikszentimahlyi make me think that happinesses may indeed be found in all avenues. For example, a politician is not inherently bad if they lie, but if they are abiding by a more pure intention to elevate the human experience for those around them. Additionally, wanting to be cool may seem lame or manipulative, but it can also be seen as an increasing form of challenge that elevates the individual. Same as playing your different roles in society. I viewed it as being disingenuous but perhaps it is a way to build additional complexity into your personality.

The Wind-up Bird Chronicle quote from ”Good things or bad things?”

"Mr Okada," she said, "I believe that you are entering a phase ofyou life in which many different things will occur. The disappearance of your cat is only the beginning."
"Different things," I said. "Good things or bad things?"
She tilted her head in thought. "Good things and bad things. Bad things that seem good at first, and good things that seem bad at first."
"That sounds very general," I said. "Don't you have any more concrete information?"
"Yes, I suppose what I am saying does sound unspecific," said Malta Kano. "But after all, Mr Okada, when one is speaking of the essence of things, it often happens that one can only speak in generalities. Concrete things capture one's attention, but they are often little more than trivia. Side shows. The more one tries to see into the distance, the more generalized things become."

The Happiest Man on Earth quote “Our life in Brussels was not perfect but we were alive. You have to try to be happy with what you've got. Life is wonderful if you're happy. Don't look on the other side of the fence. You will never be happy if you look at your neighbour and make yourself sick with jealousy.
We weren't rich, but we had enough. And let me tell you, just to have food on the table after starving in the snow for years was wonderful.”, good reminder that there are truly horrific things on earth, and that what we have needs to be carefully appreciated.

The Most Good You Can Do quote - less than 1% of average income is donated in Australia (combining both private and public spending at the personal and enterprise level). Quote: Just like Americans, most Australians do not support an increase in foreign aid, yet when asked to name what would be the right proportion of the federal budget to devote to foreign aid, they propose 10%! Although Australia's 2017 foreign aid budget represents, at 0.23% of gross national income, a slightly higher proportion than the United States, it is still a very low figure given that in 2018 Australia took over from Switzerland the title of the country with the highest median wealth per adult in the world- meaning that the typical Australian is, with assets worth US$191,450, richer than the typical person in any other country. In comparison, the typical resident of the United Kingdom has assets worth US$97,170, and of the United States, just US$61,670.26 You would think, therefore, that Australia could at least match the U.K's aid spending of 0.7% of gross national income, instead of giving only one-third of that figure.

Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End quote tells us that your focus in life is correlated to your perceived lifespan. Younger people have longer expected lifespans so focus on the future, but when your lifespan is short you focus on the now. This is related to delaying gratification. Quote: “Fifteen years later, when she was a scholar, the experience led her to formulate a hypothesis: how we seek to spend our time may depend on how much time we perceive ourselves to have. When you are young and healthy, you believe you will live forever. You do not worry about losing any of your capabilities. People tell you "the world is your oyster,» "the sky is the limit,» and so on. And you are willing to delay gratification to invest years, for example, in gaining skills and resources for a brighter future. You seek to plug into bigger streams of knowledge and information. You widen your networks of friends and connections, instead of hanging out with your mother. When horizons are measured in decades, which might as well be infinity to human beings, you most desire all that stuff at the top of Maslow's pyramid- achievement, creativity, and other attributes of "self-actualization." But as your horizons contract- -when you see the future ahead of you as finite and uncertain- -your focus shifts to the here and now, to everyday pleasures and the people closest to you.”

Flow quote brings a quote that splits predominant cultures into hedonistic and spiritualistic societies, one focusing on the individual, inner and the other on the greater than oneself. What we choose is interesting. It also proposes a middle ground, where you satisfy the base need but look for a higher spiritual one. Quote: “Sensate cultures are integrated around views of reality designed to satisfy the senses. They tend to be epicurean, utilitarian, concerned primarily with concrete needs. In such cultures art, religion, philosophy, and everyday behavior glorify and justify goals in terms of tangible experience. According to Sorokin, sensate culture predominated in Europe from about 440 to about 200 B.c., with a peak between 420 and
400 B.C.; it has become dominant once again in the past century or so, at least in the advanced capitalist democracies. People in a sensate culture are not necessarily more materialistic, but they organize their goals and justify their behavior with reference primarily to pleasure and practicality rather than to more abstract principles. The challenges they see are almost exclusively concerned with making life more easy, more comfortable, more pleasant. They tend to identify the good with what feels good and mistrust idealized values.
Ideational cultures are organized on a principle opposite from the sensate: they look down on the tangible and strive for nonmaterial, supernatural ends. They emphasize abstract principles, asceticism, and transcendence of material concerns. Art, religion, philosophy, and the justification of everyday behavior tend to be subordinated to the realiza tion of this spiritual order. People turn their attention to religion or ideology, and view their challenges not in terms of making life easier, but of reaching inner clarity and conviction”

This is interesting lmao

Value of high level vs detailed conversations

Quote: “Want to appear more senior in meetings? This is one tip I learned at McKinsey: Be mindful of the questions you ask. Juniors often talk about operational topics (How should we do this?) Seniors rather focus on organisational questions (Is the team set up for success?)”

Waking up app session “what is experience made of” has a great quote that is “experiencing reality is like feeling the grooves of a piece of wood. You cannot conceptually grasp reality as when you describe it you are but remembering what is happening an instant ago.”

On Andersen horowitz part 2 episode of acquired podcast, the closing off segment, Mark doesn’t believe in pivots or failing fast because big innovation comes from big believers who keep trying, eg edison who made the lightbulb Filiment off the 200th time.

Notion’s pricing structure has 4 tiers: Personal, personal Pro for ($4), Team for ($8) and Enterprise which is cost via sales. Personal Pro allows version history, limited collaboration and file uploads, Team allows greater collaboration and sharing

Quote from Pachinko where Hansu, the yakuza, powerful argument against idealism. Yes it can provide direction, but focus needs to be on the pragmatic, especially in times of need. This is in the context when they are all struggling in Osaka, barely having food to eat. Quote: “Hansu took a long drag of his cigarette. "You think I like it here? No, I don't like it here. But here, I know what to expect. You don't want to be poor. Changho-ya, you've worked for me, you've had enough food and money, so you've started to think about ideas that's normal. Patriotism is just an idea, so is capitalism or communism. But ideas can make men forget their own interests. And the guys in charge will exploit men who believe in ideas too much. You can't fix Korea.”

Good Strategy, Bad Strategy hammers home a point that actual strategy is about correctly diagnosing a point of high leverage not about the desired outcome

From Kafka by the shore, interesting strategy where you absorb everything you can first, just blindly copy and then choose whether or not to keep it in the future. “The facts and techniques or whatever they teach you in day isn't going to be very useful in the real world, that's for sure. Let's face it, teachers are basically a bunch of morons. But you've got to remember this: you're running away from home. You probably won't have any chance to go to school any more, so like it or not you'd better absorb whatever you can while you've got the chance. Become like a sheet of blotting paper and soak it all in. Later on you can work out what to keep and what to unload”

Let’s be critical thinkers about world events 

Good strategy, bad strategy talks about making good decisions. When you have an idea you need guidance on, you can ask that question to a panel of imaginary experts which will critique/give guidance on your ideas.

Marty Cagan in a talk here says that first principles of agile and product are:

Process:

- Empowered engineers (Missionaries not mercenaries)

- Leaders provide **conte****xt**, then let the product teams how to do it (Aligned but loosely coupled)

- Release frequently and Learn (especially when it hurts)!

- Thinking without writing is not thinking

Thinking in Bets:

* Create literal or imaginary forums of people who will give you different view points to establish a more objective opinion. Often useful when coming up with a potential solution.
* Bringing regret forward can help mitigate to heavy temporal discounting. It allows you to debate yourself on both sides. You must imagine yourself both in the moment, 5 months or 5 years from now. Allows you to make more balanced opinions. Treat these 3 views as a board of advisors.

* Ulysses contract is not so big, just taking a ride share to drinks is one form of pre commitment

Reflecting on my time with Rave Supplements:
* Lean does not mean bootstrapped

	* You want to optimise for cost (incl opportunity cost) and speed

	* I should have done more research into manufacturing and 3PL immediately

* Make your product sexy
	* Product branding is key
	* Solid marketing collateral goes such a long way

* Focus on building a profitable marketing channel

	* Get one going, monitor it and optimise

* Operations

	* VA’s are worth their weight in gold, interview many, give tasks and pick the best one
	* Good marketing collateral, and copy can be copied and reproduced 

	* Cheap services cost A LOT of your time (so be sparing when its about efficiency)

	* 3 influencers who really get you are better than 10 who are meh

		* Community building off these is the next step

	* Automate everything with ChatGPT

		* SEO is the next big step here
