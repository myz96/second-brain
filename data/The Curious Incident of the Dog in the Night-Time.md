* Giving glimpse into life of a child with Asperger’s
* Feels weird that someone without the condition writes about it so in depth, but he does it well
* It makes me wonder if I think it’s well done because he doesn’t have Asperger’s. Almost definitely. Being able to empathise with the audience probably is something that is required to write this, but also something those with Asperger’s probably struggle with.

* Interestingly though, it does also probably require a depth of empathy and understanding of those with Asperger’s more than the average person. Can someone without the condition bridge that divide. Probably if they try enough and drive towards authenticity.

* In that end, perhaps this is a good outcome, one that can be done, and indeed is done by a man with a positive agenda, one that seeks to bridge and provide understanding to the broader public, who otherwise would not have tried to understand.
* Thinking about this on the margins actually makes me think that this book did a good job in that. I have changed my mind, perhaps it is ok if people who do not actively identify with a condition, champion it, it is those that do that perhaps make the greatest impact because of it.
