* Sincerity vs seriousness is awesome, you want to engage but be able to laugh at yourself. Try do this with as many things as you can in life. For example, today at climbing, it was super fun learning how to lead, it’s okay that I’m not amazing already, but having my first fall is awesome, and it’s super special to be able to share these experiences with really good friends of yours.

* Implementation intentions

	* When I sit down at the desk to start work, I will make a mental note to keep my fingers away

* What am I scared of right now?
	* Spending more time on my second brain idea?
		* Because I am not skilled enough
		* It’s too hard
		* I’ll break stuff
		* Getting back up to speed is going to take too much time
		* There are other more important things to be working on

		* Because it’ll fail like rave-supps
