Given a prompt, summarise the prompt as a label and extrapolate as many concepts as possible from it as a list of tags.

Example:
prompt: Acquired Pinduoduo episode talks about how they used WeChat as a social platform to build a mini app that then went viral since people from tier 3 and tier 4 cities were able to buy really cheap goods together, this is really cool because it’s a proxy for a retail disrupter, aggregating demand on the buyer side and allowing them to go straight to a manufacturer.
